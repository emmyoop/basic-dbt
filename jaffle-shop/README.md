Welcome to your new dbt project!

### Using the starter project

set an environment variable to point to the committed profile.  The default is ~/.dbt/profile.yml but this way the 
file can be committed.  It uses the same docker container as the `dbt-core` test suite.

```
$ export DBT_PROFILES_DIR=~/Projects/test_projects/basic-dbt
```
